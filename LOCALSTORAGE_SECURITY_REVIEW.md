# localStorage Security Review

## Overview
This document reviews the usage of localStorage in the VibeCTO.ai application and provides security recommendations.

## Current localStorage Usage

### 1. Supabase Auth Storage
**Location**: `/src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
```typescript
auth: {
  storage: localStorage,
  persistSession: true,
  autoRefreshToken: true,
}
```
**Data Stored**: Supabase authentication tokens and session data
**Security Assessment**: ✅ ACCEPTABLE
- This is standard practice for Supabase authentication
- Tokens are short-lived and auto-refresh
- Only the anonymous session token is stored (no user credentials)

### 2. Adventure Game State (Zustand)
**Location**: `/src/components/adventure/gameStore.ts`
**Storage Key**: `adventure-game-storage`
**Data Stored**:
```typescript
{
  playerName: string,           // Player's chosen name
  isGeneratedName: boolean,     // Whether name was auto-generated
  currentSceneId: string,       // Current game scene
  sessionStartTime: string,     // When session started
  visitedScenes: Record,        // Which scenes visited
  pathScores: Record,           // Game scoring
  choices: Array,               // Player choices
  discoveredPaths: Array,       // Game paths discovered
  unlockedContent: Array,       // Unlocked game content
  preferences: {                // User preferences
    soundEnabled: boolean,
    musicVolume: number,
    effectsVolume: number,
  },
  completionStatus: Record      // Game completion status
}
```
**Security Assessment**: ✅ ACCEPTABLE
- No sensitive personal information (emails, phone numbers) stored
- Only game state and preferences
- Player name is either generated or user-provided (non-PII)
- Session ID is NOT persisted to localStorage

## Security Findings

### ✅ Positive Findings
1. **No PII in localStorage**: Email addresses, phone numbers, and other personal data are NOT stored in localStorage
2. **Session ID not persisted**: The session ID is only stored in memory (Zustand state) and not persisted to localStorage
3. **Appropriate data scope**: Only game state and non-sensitive preferences are stored
4. **Standard auth pattern**: Supabase auth storage follows security best practices

### ⚠️ Recommendations

1. **Consider sessionStorage for temporary data**
   - Game state could use sessionStorage instead of localStorage
   - This would clear data when browser tab closes
   - Decision depends on desired user experience

2. **Implement data expiration**
   ```typescript
   // Add timestamp to stored data
   const storeWithExpiry = (key: string, value: any, ttlMinutes: number = 1440) => {
     const item = {
       value: value,
       expiry: new Date().getTime() + (ttlMinutes * 60 * 1000)
     };
     localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(item));
   };

   // Check expiry when retrieving
   const getWithExpiry = (key: string) => {
     const itemStr = localStorage.getItem(key);
     if (!itemStr) return null;
     
     const item = JSON.parse(itemStr);
     if (new Date().getTime() > item.expiry) {
       localStorage.removeItem(key);
       return null;
     }
     return item.value;
   };
   ```

3. **Add localStorage quota management**
   - Monitor storage usage
   - Implement cleanup for old game sessions
   - Handle quota exceeded errors gracefully

4. **Document storage policy**
   - Add comment in gameStore.ts explaining what data is stored and why
   - Document data retention period
   - Explain why localStorage vs sessionStorage was chosen

## Implementation Priority

Given the current security posture:
- **PRIORITY: LOW** - Current implementation is secure
- No sensitive data is exposed
- Standard patterns are followed
- Improvements are optional enhancements

## Conclusion

The localStorage usage in this application follows security best practices:
- ✅ No PII or sensitive data stored
- ✅ Session IDs kept in memory only
- ✅ Standard Supabase auth pattern
- ✅ Only game state and preferences persisted

The suggested improvements are optional enhancements that would add defense-in-depth but are not required to address any security vulnerabilities.
