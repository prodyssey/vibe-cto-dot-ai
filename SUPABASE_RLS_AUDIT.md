# Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) Audit

## Overview

This document analyzes the Supabase database usage in the vibe-cto-dot-ai project and provides recommendations for implementing proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

## Current State Analysis

### Tables Identified

1. **adventure_sessions** - Stores game session data including player names and emails
2. **adventure_choices** - Records player choices during the game
3. **adventure_scene_visits** - Tracks which scenes players visited
4. **adventure_analytics** - Analytics events for the adventure game
5. **ignition_waitlist** - Waitlist entries for the Ignition program
6. **launch_control_waitlist** - Waitlist entries (referenced but not in schema)
7. **ignition_qualifications** - Qualification form data (referenced but not in schema)

### Current Security Issues

ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**: No authentication is implemented
- All database operations use the anon key without any user authentication
- No RLS policies appear to be in place (based on code analysis)
- Any client with the anon key can potentially access/modify all data

### Data Access Patterns

1. **Inserts (Public Write Access)**:
   - `adventure_sessions` - Creating/updating game sessions
   - `adventure_choices` - Recording player choices
   - `adventure_scene_visits` - Tracking scene visits
   - `adventure_analytics` - Logging analytics events
   - `ignition_waitlist` - Adding waitlist entries
   - `launch_control_waitlist` - Adding waitlist entries
   - `ignition_qualifications` - Submitting qualification data

2. **Reads (Public Read Access)**:
   - `adventure_sessions` - Reading session data by ID
   - No other explicit reads found in the codebase

3. **Updates**:
   - `adventure_sessions` - Updating email, final outcome
   
4. **Deletes**:
   - `adventure_sessions` - Deleting sessions by ID

## Recommended RLS Policies

Since this is a marketing website with anonymous users, we need to implement RLS policies that:
1. Allow anonymous users to create their own data
2. Prevent users from accessing others' data
3. Protect sensitive information like emails

### 1. adventure_sessions

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE adventure_sessions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Users can insert their own sessions
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own sessions" ON adventure_sessions
FOR INSERT TO anon
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Policy: Users can only read their own sessions (using session_id from localStorage)
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own sessions" ON adventure_sessions
FOR SELECT TO anon
USING (id = current_setting('request.headers')::json->>'x-session-id');

-- Policy: Users can update their own sessions
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own sessions" ON adventure_sessions
FOR UPDATE TO anon
USING (id = current_setting('request.headers')::json->>'x-session-id');

-- Policy: Users can delete their own sessions
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own sessions" ON adventure_sessions
FOR DELETE TO anon
USING (id = current_setting('request.headers')::json->>'x-session-id');
```

### 2. adventure_choices

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE adventure_choices ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Users can insert choices for their sessions
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert choices" ON adventure_choices
FOR INSERT TO anon
WITH CHECK (
  session_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM adventure_sessions 
    WHERE id = current_setting('request.headers')::json->>'x-session-id'
  )
);
```

### 3. adventure_scene_visits

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE adventure_scene_visits ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Users can insert/update visits for their sessions
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage scene visits" ON adventure_scene_visits
FOR ALL TO anon
USING (
  session_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM adventure_sessions 
    WHERE id = current_setting('request.headers')::json->>'x-session-id'
  )
);
```

### 4. adventure_analytics

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE adventure_analytics ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Allow inserts only (write-only table for analytics)
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can insert analytics" ON adventure_analytics
FOR INSERT TO anon
WITH CHECK (true);

-- No SELECT policy - analytics should only be read by admin
```

### 5. Waitlist Tables

```sql
-- Enable RLS on waitlist tables
ALTER TABLE ignition_waitlist ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Anyone can insert (it's a public waitlist)
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can join waitlist" ON ignition_waitlist
FOR INSERT TO anon
WITH CHECK (true);

-- No SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE policies for public users
```

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Session-Based Access Control

Since the app uses anonymous users with session IDs stored in localStorage:

```typescript
// Update Supabase client to include session header
import { supabase } from '@/integrations/supabase/client';

// Add session ID to all requests
const supabaseWithSession = supabase.auth.setCustomAccessToken((token) => {
  const sessionId = localStorage.getItem('sessionId');
  return {
    ...token,
    headers: {
      ...token.headers,
      'x-session-id': sessionId || ''
    }
  };
});
```

### 2. Alternative: Use Supabase Auth

Consider implementing Supabase Anonymous Auth for better security:

```typescript
// Create anonymous user on first visit
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInAnonymously();

// This provides a proper auth context for RLS policies
```

### 3. Sensitive Data Protection

- Email addresses should be write-only from the client
- Consider server-side functions for operations involving PII
- Implement rate limiting on public endpoints

### 4. Admin Access

Create separate admin policies for internal use:

```sql
-- Admin can read all data
CREATE POLICY "Admin full access" ON adventure_sessions
FOR ALL TO authenticated
USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin');
```

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Enable RLS on all tables
- [ ] Implement session-based access control
- [ ] Create write-only policies for sensitive data
- [ ] Set up rate limiting in Supabase
- [ ] Implement proper error handling (don't expose internal errors)
- [ ] Consider moving to authenticated users (even anonymous auth)
- [ ] Set up monitoring for suspicious activity
- [ ] Regular security audits of RLS policies

## Testing RLS Policies

After implementing RLS policies, test them:

```sql
-- Test as anon user
SET ROLE anon;
SET request.headers = '{"x-session-id": "test-session-123"}';

-- Try to read someone else's session (should fail)
SELECT * FROM adventure_sessions WHERE id = 'other-session-456';

-- Try to read own session (should succeed)
SELECT * FROM adventure_sessions WHERE id = 'test-session-123';
```

## Next Steps

1. Log into Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication â†’ Policies
3. Implement the RLS policies above
4. Update the client code to pass session headers
5. Test thoroughly with different session IDs
6. Monitor for any access violations

## Important Notes

- The anon key is public by design but should only allow specific operations
- Never rely solely on client-side validation
- RLS policies are your last line of defense
- Consider implementing rate limiting at the Supabase level
- Regular security audits are essential
