When you're ready to deploy your Lovable or Bolt creation to production, security should be your top priority. Here's a comprehensive checklist to bulletproof your application.

## Table of Contents

## 1. Environment Variables & Secrets

Never hardcode sensitive information in your codebase:

- [ ] Move all API keys to environment variables
- [ ] Use `.env.local` for development secrets
- [ ] Ensure `.env` files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Use a secrets management service for production

```bash
# Good
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Bad - never do this
const apiKey = "sk-abcd1234..."
```

## 2. Input Validation

Protect against malicious input:

- [ ] Validate all user inputs on both client and server
- [ ] Use schema validation libraries (Zod, Joi, etc.)
- [ ] Sanitize HTML inputs to prevent XSS
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on API endpoints

## 3. Authentication & Authorization

Secure user access properly:

- [ ] Use established auth providers (Auth0, Clerk, Supabase)
- [ ] Implement proper session management
- [ ] Add role-based access controls
- [ ] Enable 2FA for admin accounts

## 4. HTTPS & SSL

Encrypt data in transit:

- [ ] Force HTTPS in production
- [ ] Use HSTS headers
- [ ] Implement proper SSL certificate management
- [ ] Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

## 5. Database Security

Protect your data layer:

- [ ] Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- [ ] Implement proper database access controls
- [ ] Enable database encryption at rest
- [ ] Regular database backups with encryption

## 6. API Security

Secure your endpoints:

- [ ] Implement proper CORS policies
- [ ] Use API rate limiting
- [ ] Add request size limits
- [ ] Implement proper error handling (don't leak stack traces)

## 7. Dependencies & Updates

Keep your stack secure:

- [ ] Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Keep frameworks and libraries updated
- [ ] Use tools like `npm audit` or Snyk
- [ ] Monitor security advisories

## 8. Monitoring & Logging

Stay informed about security events:

- [ ] Implement proper logging for security events
- [ ] Set up error monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket)
- [ ] Monitor failed login attempts
- [ ] Set up alerts for suspicious activity

## 9. Content Security Policy

Prevent XSS and injection attacks:

- [ ] Implement a strict CSP header
- [ ] Whitelist trusted domains for resources
- [ ] Use nonce or hash-based CSP for inline scripts
- [ ] Test CSP policies thoroughly

## 10. Security Headers

Add essential security headers:

```nginx
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```

## Pre-Launch Security Review

Before going live:

- [ ] Run a security scan (OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite)
- [ ] Perform a penetration test
- [ ] Review all third-party integrations
- [ ] Document your security measures
- [ ] Create an incident response plan

## Conclusion

Security isn't a one-time setupâ€”it's an ongoing process. Regularly review and update your security measures as your application grows and evolves.

Remember: it's better to be overly cautious than to deal with a security breach after launch.
