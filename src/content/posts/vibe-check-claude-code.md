Vibe check: Claude code is the most impressive coding agent I've tried yet.

Seems more effective than using Claude Sonnet 4 in Cursor - and that is really good.

Tying it to a predictable max plan that gives a ceiling to costs vs. worrying about how many tokens you're paying for was also a good adjustment. I'm getting more comfortable with paying for tokens (ask me about my "ai stuff" budget line item ðŸ˜¬), but this is a good balance.

I'm planning to try one of the wrappers for Claude code that runs multiple agents in parallel for my next from scratch project and will report back.

Anybody having luck with those or is there something else I should be exploring?
