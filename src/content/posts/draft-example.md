# This is a Hidden Post

This post has `hidden: true` in its frontmatter, so it won't appear in:
- The Resources listing page
- The homepage Resources section

However, if you know the direct URL (`/resources/draft-example`), you can still access it.

This is useful for:
- Draft posts you're still working on
- Private content for specific audiences
- Posts scheduled for future release

To make this post public, simply remove the `hidden: true` line from the frontmatter or set it to `false`.
