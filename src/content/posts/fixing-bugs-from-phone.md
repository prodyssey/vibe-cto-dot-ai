I used Claude code to fix something that's been bothering me for monthsâ€¦ from my phone.

Ever since I redid my old broken personal website last fall using cursor, I noticed that the header image to one of the posts I reference often was broken. Not a big enough deal to drop everything and troubleshoot and fix, but enough to be an ongoing annoyance.

Given all the progress I've been making with Claude code, I decided to try to fix it last night after all the household chores were done but before fully winding down with a show.

I opened up my prompt 3 terminal iOS app and connected to my docked laptop from the couch and asked Claude to find and fix all broken images on the site since I figured it wasn't the only one.

After a couple of back and forths, it found several but didn't fix the problem that was annoying me. I poked it again to look at "the core values post" and it found and fixed a pretty complicated issue in the image optimization code.

I had it make a pull request so I could review the deploy preview on netlify, but I was able to direct the change, review the code, and test the output all from my phone. Whole process took less than 20 minutes even with fumbling through the process.

I'm willing to bet this type of thing is going to be productized pretty soon but it's easy enough now for developer types who make the space to try it.

Now instead of just ruminating on something I don't have time to fix or move forward, I have a chance to make real progress and move on to something else like actually trying to relax and recharge.
