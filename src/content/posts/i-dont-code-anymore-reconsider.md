"I don't code anymore." Maybe reconsider.

I was the I don't code anymore guy from 2015 until 2021.

If that's you, you might just be well positioned to be one of the best builders out there given the tools now.

You might understand what needs to be done and have some thoughts about what good looks like. You've probably managed people which is way harder than managing robots.

Pick up the AI tools. Right now it's Claude code, tomorrow it could be something else. Give it a shot. Get your hands dirty.

The last year especially, the engineering managers and product folks are among the people building the best stuff.

You can do this.
