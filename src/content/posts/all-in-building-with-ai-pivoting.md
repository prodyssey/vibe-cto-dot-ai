I'm all in on building with AI. And I'm pivoting my consulting business to reflect that.

Today, I'm officially launching VibeCTO.ai - human help to build better with AI.

Vibe coding, augmented engineering with agents, and all the operational glue around the whole building process.

I've been building with these tools since GitHub copilot launched in 2022. I've been pragmatically testing and adopting the best advances.

This year, I'm experiencing an incredible boost in my ability to:

- Accelerate roadmaps
- Prototype new ideas
- Create interactive content
- Streamline internal operations

I want to help others get that boost too.

People are smart and capable and could figure these things out on their own for the most part. A lot of them are just struggling to make enough time to do it well.

I want to be a shortcut or "clone yourself" option for those folks.

I'm focused primarily on helping more mature companies adopt AI agents and workflows effectively, but I'm making some space for early stage focused offerings as well.

My mission in recent years has been to unlock the joy of building in as many people as possible. Effectively applied, there's no better tool I've found than AI agents to do that so far.

I know I'm having fun. "[Press start](/adventure)" and see for yourself.

P.S. I am _not_ an expert in Veo and CapCut but they are also lots of fun in their own right if nothing else as potential nightmare fuel generators.
