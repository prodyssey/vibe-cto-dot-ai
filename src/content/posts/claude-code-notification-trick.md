I'm having trouble reliably getting Claude code to notify me it needs my input when using my preferred method of running it inside a cursor terminal.

For now my one weird trick for when I start getting too into a secondary priority task is set a watch timer for a few minutes.

Waiting for the better solution someone shares with me ðŸ˜„
