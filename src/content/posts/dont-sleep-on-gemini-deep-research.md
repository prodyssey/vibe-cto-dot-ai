Don't sleep on Gemini deep research.

When I'm exploring a problem vs working with robots to implement a clear solution, I often eject from Claud code and pose the outline of the problem to multiple llms.

o3(-pro), opus 4(.1), Gemini 2.5 pro, etc.

It seems like every time, one of them stands out but it's not super consistent which one.

Today, o3 gave me helpful tactical suggestions but I was blown away by what Gemini deep research came back with on a new to me subject that I could then turn into a quick roadmap of PoCs (to pair with Claude code on, of course).

I've tried a researcher sub agent, but haven't gotten as good of results just yet.

What's working for you for problem exploration?
