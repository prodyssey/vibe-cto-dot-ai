I understand why so many people want to tell scary stories about what AI means for the future. Lots of "here's why X job is probably going away" or "you need to prove you're using AI or else" or "this stuff is useless and / or dangerous".

All of those things might be true.

But, what if more of us led with excitement and curiosity instead of fear uncertainty and doubt? More "what if this works" and "here are ways we can attack the challenges we see" and less "you'll regret this!"

I've seen real upsides in my day to day work, and I see a lot of paths to a much better future for lots of people who are supposedly "cooked".

What if, for the first time all of us actually CAN do more with less instead of it being an empty platitude that makes people roll their eyes?

We don't have to ignore the risks and downsides, and we don't have to make big pronouncements about the future that none of us can predict.

I want to do my part to lead in doing a lot more showing and teaching what is possible now while helping navigate the risks, and less shooting things down and speculating about how doomed various professions are.

To put my time and money where my mouth is, I'm experimenting with a new "vibe CTO" offering in addition to my typical consulting.

It would be focused on supporting and helping less technical folks find paths to building sustainable products paired with the right AI enabled software engineering approaches when they start to run into walls with the vibe coding tools they're experimenting with.
