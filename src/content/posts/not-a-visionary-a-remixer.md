I've accepted that I'm not really a visionary in the way most people imagine.

I'm also not fully an "integrator" the way it's used in EOS.

I'm more of a remixer.

Looking back at the times I feel I've been most creative and effective in my life and career, I was bouncing off the creative energy of a visionary partner or a frustrated customer, and then taking the lead in bringing remixed ideas to life.

AI can be a great thought partner or virtual widget cranker. I'm having as much fun career wise as I ever have leaning in to what the models and the products built on them help me do as a super contributor.

I'm experimenting a lot right now to find more and more ways to apply them, and most days I feel much more productive than I ever have.

But, I still haven't found any of the true magic moments of creative alchemy that I remember the most.

That's why I'm trying to lean into creating more of those situations with other humans too, and remixing with the robot magic on top of it all.

Let's build together.
