"The work lost to inertia" - this is what AI coding tools are helping me with that I personally appreciate the most.

Don't get me wrong, I feel like they're an accelerant + pair programmer + tons of other things for me in the day to day work I was doing anyway. I'm working on applying my measurement frameworks to better understand where they're most effective in as many situations as I personally can.

But, I can't tell you how many projects I've started since I was 12 that I didn't get to a shareable state because I got lost in getting the project setup just right or just plain lost momentum. "Yak shaving."

Now I can get to something tangible that is maybe 30-40% there really fast. And 30-40% is way better for keeping momentum than 1-2% and getting wrapped up in little things that kill motivation.

With little kids at home, what precious time and mental energy I have that doesn't go to my family or my client work can't have any inertia, or it dies.

I appreciate [this blog post](https://www.treycausey.com/blog/posts/superagency-adhd/) that gave me this turn of phrase. Maybe it will resonate with some of you too.
