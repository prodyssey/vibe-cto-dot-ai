Most of us lose our patience for being a complete beginner.

We have so many opportunities now to try new things. It's such a small percentage of the time that we can have noticeable results quickly and it's easy to get frustrated.

Don't give up. And don't get lost in reading, passive speculation, or existential dread.

Step up to the plate and swing and miss 6 times in a row. Then come back tomorrow and swing and miss 6 more times.

You'll probably get better faster than you think. Good coaching helps too.
